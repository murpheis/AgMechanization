This repository contains the code for Emily Eisner’s research paper studying the impact of tractor adoption on Mid-Western farmers in the US.

The code is separated into “clean” and “analyze” subfolders. In each sub-directory, there is a code, temp, input, and output folder.

The clean code does all the data preparation and building. The analyze code does the analysis and figures included in the paper and appendices.
